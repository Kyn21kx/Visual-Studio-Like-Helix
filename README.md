# Visual-Studio-Like-Helix
Configuration file for the Helix text editor to be closer to Visual Studio with Visual Assist

## Why?
I just really liked Helix, but I don't want to learn all the motions, so...

## It's Visual Studio-like not VsCode-Like
If you're coming from VS Code, this might still feel familiar, however, do keep in mind that my objective is to mimic VS x VA functionality, not VS Code.

## About Visual Assist
I use VA as my main development plugin when working in C++ and C# projects, so I wanted to extend the ease of use that it provides me and combined with the lighting-fast performance of Helix, it feels just like the real thing
### Supported bindings
- Alt + Shift + O => Fuzzy search panel
- Alt + Shift + Q => Code actions / Rename symbol
- Alt + M => Open symbol picker
- F12 => Go to definition

## Maintenance
This repo is truly for personal purposes (AKA, I do not want to lose my config if my PC dies), but I thought it might be useful for someone else like me that likes a lighting fast editor, but doesn't have the time to learn all the complicated motions.

That being said, I don't know how much I'll be able to keep this config up to date, but as Helix becomes one of my main editing tools I might continue adding on features to mimic Visual Studio x VA.

## Additional languages
- GDScript (you must first download the [NCat / NMap](https://nmap.org/download#windows) command line utility if not on Linux)
- GLSL (requires [GLSL Analyzer](https://github.com/nolanderc/glsl_analyzer) to be installed)
